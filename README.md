# PlanYourMeal
Meal planner and recipe data base.

# Description
Project prepared in the Scrum methodology during the bootcamp
"working alone" week. Works on the project were a simulation of
the Agile enviroment. I have prepared logic related to the meal
schedule adding, editing and removing. The code has been written
in plain vanilla JS. We have used Webpack, Git and Sass.
