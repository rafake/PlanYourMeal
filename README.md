# PlanYourMeal
One of the projects prepared in the Scrum methodology during the bootcamp "working alone" week. This week was to simulate the Agile enviroment. We were working remotely in a team of three persons. Merging of the project has shown certain conflicts which effected in some visual bugs. I have prepared logic related to the meal schedule adding, editing and removing. Some of the features need more testing and fixing. The code has been written in plain vanilla JS.
